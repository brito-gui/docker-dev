### Docker for development ###
Setting up your environment
1. Save your GitHub key under config/ssh/id_rsa
2. Configure the ports that you want to use in docker-compose.yml
2.1. ports:
        - '8080:80'
     Where the 8080 is the local port and 80 is the container port.
     You can have more than one container using the same port, but no duplicated local ports.
3. If you want to change the domain, change it under config/apache2/sites-enabled/default.config
3.1. Include this domain to your host file.
4. Create/Copy a .env file.
5. Optional: Run a composer install in your project folder to speedup the process
5.1. You can remove `composer commands from docker-entrypoint.sh` if you want, but you need to install all the dependencies in your environment.
5.2. Database configuration example: `DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:root_password@mysql:3307/db`
     Where mysql as host is the docker link name. Check docker-compose.yml link settings.


6. Run the docker-compose build, it will create the custom container images
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build

7. Run the docker-compose up, it will start the containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up


Your services are now running.

PHPMyAdmin - http://localhost:8090/
Project HTTP - http://localhost:8080/
Project HTTPS - https://localhost:8433/
MemCache Server - localhost:11211
